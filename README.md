# Journal CLI

Journal CLI is exactly what you think it is: a CLI journal application. No current dependencies, you just need a version of Python 3.

It's small... but it's a start!! I'll be adding to it as the project develops. 

# Updates
- Version 1.0.2 
   - Some under-the-hood clean up of functions.
   - Added a read journal function so we can read our previous entries. We just print the content to the console for now...

- Version 1.0.1
    - Updated dependencies
        - pathlib --> check requirements.txt
    - New config file for initial setup
        - Author
        - Subject
        - First Entry
        - Last Entry
        - Total Entries

    Journal CLI will create a .json config file upon first run and create some meta data about your journal.
